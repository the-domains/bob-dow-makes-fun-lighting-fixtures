These are custom panels I'm using for the top rail on our stairwells. They are extruded panels backed by holographic foil so they sparkle in the daytime (seen here) and are backlit by Philips Hue strips and controlled by iPhone. Why? I wanted to do something fun and unexpected. The acrylic ice is a fantasy element. It creates rainbows during the day and also at night when the strip is turned to true white. It's classy and trashy at the same time.
