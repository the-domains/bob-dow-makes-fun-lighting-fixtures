this is a 3200 pixel matrix on the wall in our living room. It's about 10ft x 10ft. I'm using controllers made by SanDevices. They speak the DMX protocol. I was using it as a prototype for a 10,000 pixel version to bring to Burning Man. The wind really didn't help me succeed.   
I'm retooling. It's called "Temporary Enlightenment" and is essentially a giant selfie maker that doubles as a pretty amazing party light.
